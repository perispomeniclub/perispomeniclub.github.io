It was 2015 when I started perispomeni.club and back then I would not imagine
that this will me my longest running project. 

As you can imagine, this server is not for free. It has a real cost in terms of 
resources. More specifically, I host this on a small instance on DigitalOcean 
with automatic backups enabled. That amounts to about $7.5/month and the 
perispomeni.club domain runs around $15/year. If you do the math, this colaborative
server costs above $100/year.

I thought about different solutions on how to ease the burden that is my hosting 
bills. What I came up with is inspired by what Nathaniel Smith does for 
[tilde.town](tilde.town). I set up a Patreon page. There you can put your donations
and we can crack goals.

If it does not work I will cut the server down with early notice of course and we
will all part our seperate ways with no hard feelings.

The plan is, I will put a donation button somewhere. If you feel like it,
you press it and you give me money to keep the site humming. This is not for my 
manhours. It is just for the resources.
By my calculations, if each member puts aside a beer's worth of money each 
year ($5), this server will humm to eternity as is. Me in return will periodically 
upload the invoices from DigitalOcean and the domain company so you know I am 
not using the money for beer. If enough of you donate we will be able to have a 
more powerful server. Of course if you wanna throw in something extra 
you can do that and I will print and sent you some of my photography or other stuff
from Greece.

If you don't feel like donating, that's fine. It is a donation and not a subscription.
If you have other ideas or you are itching to tell me I am doing something 
completely wrong and I can cut the cost in half, please do.
