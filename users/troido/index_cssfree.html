<h1>Hello, I'm Troido</h1>

<p>I will probably put some programming experiments on this tilde soon.</p>
<p>I have been trying out some stuff with javascript and html5 the last year.<br />
Most of my projects I put on my website <a href="http://troido.nl">troido.nl</a>.<br />
<!--
Some of the best projects I made are:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://troido.nl/orbox/orbox.html">Orbox</a>. I also made a <a href="http://troido.nl/orbox/orboxEditor.html">level editor for orbox</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://troido.nl/platform/platform.html">A platformer game</a>. It may take a while to load the game in firefox. It also looks better in a chromium browser than in firefox.</li>
<li><a href="http://troido.nl/minesweeper/minesweeper.html">Minesweeper</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://troido.nl/shooter/shooter.html">A top-down shooter</a>. I still want to make this in 3d, when the code is a bit better.</li>
</ul>
Most of these games are not finished yet.

I am currently working on an object-oriented rewrite of my orbox game for this tilde.<br />
I have something working now: <a href="orbox/">Orbox</a>.<br />
It is still unfinished, I have to add some CSS.
</p>
<p>
Another project I'm recently working on is to improve the source code of my <a href="platform/">platformer game</a>.<br />
Actually it is not a game as you can only walk and jump around.<br />
I am testing it here, so don't be surprised if it's broken sometimes.

<p>
*Only for tilde.red users:*<br />
Some time ago I said in the IRC that I had written a program in C that would draw 3d stuff in the terminal using ascii.<br />
By now I managed to get the segfaults etc out, and I uploaded it.<br />
In the directory /home/troido/projects/terminal3d/ you can find the executable, the manual and the (ugly) source code.
</p>
<p>
If you have any feedback about the programs, please tell me :-)
