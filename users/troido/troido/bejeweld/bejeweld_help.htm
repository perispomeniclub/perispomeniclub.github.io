In the game Bejeweled, the goal is to make rows of at least three the same colors.<br />
The rows can be either horizontal or vertical.<br />
To get such rows, you can switch two adjacent colors with each other by clicking them.<br />
You can, however, only switch them if there will be a pair of at least three colors.<br />
If you manage to make multiple pairs with just one switching, you will get bonus points.<br />
The goal is to make as many combo's as possible in 42 moves.
